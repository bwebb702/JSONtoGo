Install JSONtoGo folder as a Go package, then build main.go. Python 3.0+ must be installed to use, as the program uses the tkinter file open dialog.

To use:
Run the main.exe file you built, then select the appropriate JSON file you wish to parse. Only JSON files are accepted. Once an appropriate file is selected, you will be prompted to enter the name of the struct. Enter a name, press enter. Go struct code will be generated and can be copied from the terminal window. Press enter to exit the program.
